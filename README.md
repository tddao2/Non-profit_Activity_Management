# Summary

Building a web application following a standard full-stack architecture using the MEVN stack ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)).

### Story

[Bread of Life](https://breadoflifeinc.org/) began in 1992 by serving 500 hot meals a day to homeless individuals in midtown Houston. With the help of a close partnership with Beyonce and Tina Knowles-Lawson, they have coordinated numerous anti-hunger initiatives and provided emergency support during natural disasters, in addition to their outreach to the homeless. They need data tracking and reporting to support their activities in homeless outreach, anti-hunger campaigns, and health outcomes in the communities served.

### Goal

The goal is to develop an application that will support the management of activities in a non-profit organization in the Houston area. Also, it will help to build a basic data platform for a more efficient and data driven approach to their services.
